# Lab1

* **Task-1:** Spam classification with nearest neighbors.

* **Task-2:** Feature selection by cross-validation in a linear model.

* **Task-3:** Linear regression and regularization.


# Lab2

* **Task-1:** LDA and logistic regression.

* **Task-2:** Analysis of credit scoring.

* **Task-3:** Uncertainty estimation.

* **Task-4:** Principal components.



# Lab3

* **Task-1:** Implement a kernel method to predict the hourly temperatures for a date and place in Sweden. To do so, you are provided with the files stations.csv and temps50k.csv. These files contain information about weather stations and temperature measurements in the stations at different days and times. The data have been kindly provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).

* **Task-2:** Train a neural network to learn the trigonometric sine function.


# Lab2-Block 2 

* **Task-1:** Using GAM and GLM to examine the mortality rates.

* **Task-2:** High-dimensional methods.




# Lab1-Block 2 

* **Task-1:** Implement ENSEMBLE methods to classfiy the Spam data using AdaBost and randomForest algorithm and also compare its error rate of both the algorithm.

* **Task-2:** implement the EM algorithm for mixtures of multivariate Benouilli distributions.Then, use your implementation to show what happens when your mixture models has too few and too many components and compare the result.
